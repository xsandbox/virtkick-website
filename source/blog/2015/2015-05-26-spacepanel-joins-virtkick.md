Virtkick development is underway, with our team expanded to 8 people - we've been working on the networking part of Virtkick and fine-tuning the user experience. We're so excited that we're getting closer to the Virtkick release - it'll be worth the wait!

Speaking of team, ever heard of [SpacePanel](https://spacepanel.io)? An open-source cloud management panel, just like Virtkick. We got in touch with its creators and found out we share the same vision - we want to create a great cloud management tool for people. 

So we decided to join forces and build Virtkick together - and this is how [Joe Pettit joined the Virtkick rocket crew](https://www.virtkick.com/people.html).

Joe is a great man to have on board - not only is he a killer coder but he's also done lots of open source coding and has worked at DigitalOcean and Linode so he brings lots of virtualization knowledge to the crew.  

We're going forward, stronger every day - if you'd like to check how Virtkick looks and works like, check out our [demo](https://demo.virtkick.com) and subscribe for the [limited release](https://www.virtkick.com/pricing.html#release)!
