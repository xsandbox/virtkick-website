The last three weeks were hell of a ride at the rocket named Virtkick. We've deployed the Virtkick's limited release to 10 hosting providers and prepared more than 20 clients for the next deployment! 

Virtkick is already present in the US, UK, Italy, France, New Zealand And Australia. We'd like to thank our early adopters for working with us on the deployment, testing Virtkick on their machines and putting it out for their clients to use. We receive a great amount of feedback - and we use it to make Virtkick even better. 

And those early adopters will be able to serve their customers commercially soon - we've been working on the network integration lately, so it's a matter of few weeks of coding to have the first  end customers use Virtkick and pay our early adopters through Virtkick's integrated billing system! 

##Up, up, up - progress

The virtualisation backend part is ready, networks are being done as we speak and we've added some sweet front-end magic crafted by our designer - [the awesome m13](https://www.virtkick.com/people.html). 

Plus, we took on a developer and two sysadmins on board to speed up the development! We shoot for May to have a registration ready at the website, so you'd just connect your hypervisors to Virtkick via IP/SSH and amaze your clients with your own, white label Virtkick panel. 

##Would you like a limited release?

We've rolled out the limited release to our early adopters and they're loving it. As an UK client put it:

*"Before I forget, initial impressions on VirtKick... love the simplicity, love the implementation of our colors and logo and love everything about it :D"*

And some nice words from an US customer:

*"Console integration is really cool - that's really lightweight."*

Want to awesomize your business with Virtkick? We just need a few technical details and some information about your business -  just [shoot me an email](mailto:mirek@virtkick.com) and we'll work together on deploying Virtkick for your business.
