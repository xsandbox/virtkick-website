VirtKick's v.0.5 alpha is out, with a brand new package for CentOS 7.0 and openSUSE 13.2. We've also added some nice UI improvements to make your VMs spin even faster. To get the new package run:

```
yum install https://download.virtkick.io/latest.rpm
```
###VirtKick Roadmap Survey

Many of you asked about our plans and we decided to give you a say about VirtKick's next steps in an anonymous survey. Answering every question was optional.

We've received over 200 responses and are very humbled by such a number of replies - thank you! We'll use this data to better shape VirtKick to your needs. Here are the questions and the results:

**1. Who are you?**

a) VPS Provider - 30%

b) Developer/SysAdmin/Devops etc. - 64%

c) Other - 5%

**2. If a) VPS Provider - How many customers do you serve?**

a) 10-50 - 10%

b) 50-500 - 8%

c) 500 or more - 11%

d) No answer - 6%

**3. What will you use VirtKick for?**

a) Private Cloud - 52%

b) Homelab - 44%

c) Playing with virtualization on localhost - 34%

d) Selling virtual machines	- 22%

What is even more awesome, **over 20 VPS providers opted in to working closely with VirtKick** about sharing their VPS stories and knowledge. And they'll be the first to use VirtKick for serving their customers when we implement our billing module (which is around mid-February). Stay tuned!
