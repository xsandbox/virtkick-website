VirtKick is a self-hosted cloud panel, similar to DigitalOcean.
Just give it a try!

<!--more-->

```
# for CentOS 7
yum install https://www.virtkick.io/download/latest.rpm

# for openSUSE 13.2
zypper install https://www.virtkick.io/download/latest.rpm
```

Then go to **http://your-server:3000/** and create your first VirtKick-driven virtual machine. Happy hacking!


If you don't have CentOS or openSUSE by hand, [install VirtKick on DigitalOcean](https://deploy.virtkick.io/).
If you'd want to try it on a different VPS, your provider needs to support nested virtualization.
It's not common, so it's best to go for DigitalOcean.

## One day left in our crowdfunding campaign

We have collected $21,767 from multiple sources. Our next goal, support for OpenVZ, is only ~$5,000 away.
Will we make it? Please proceed to [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/virtkick-take-cloud-back)
if you think OpenVZ is worth its price, or you just want to support us gratuitously. :-)
